# Fifa-Loginpage-Clone

This project replicates the visual style and user interface of the FIFA login page. 
It includes the following key features:

- Full-Screen Background: A background with FIFA branding or related images.
- Login Form: Contains fields for username and password, with clear labels.
- Login Button: A green "Log In" button that changes color when hovered over.
- Forgot Password Link: A clickable link for users to recover their password.
- Responsive Design: Ensures the page looks great on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Minimalist and Clean Design: Simple, modern layout with a focus on usability.

The project was developed with **HTML** for structure and **CSS** for styling, with the possibility to extend with JavaScript for further interactivity (e.g., password visibility toggle, form validation).
